GA4GH DRS Client Documentation
===============================

The `GA4GH DRS Client <https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh-drs-client>`_ is a 
Python-based command-line application for requesting omics data and metadata 
from web services that are compliant with the 
`Data Repository Service (DRS) API Specification <https://github.com/ga4gh/data-repository-service-schemas>`_. 
The DRS API specification, developed by the 
`Global Alliance for Genomics and Health <https://www.ga4gh.org/>`_, 
serves to provide a standardized API framework to allow for interoperability of
datasets hosted at different institutions.

Click `here <installation.html>`_ for instructions on how to install the client.
